Web Site and Datacenter are under construction, coming soon...

Site address (Still under construction): https://dev.oobase.com/ 

Develop api address: https://dev.oobase.com/api.php

We need designers, web builders, programmers of all languages, and those who have interests...

Notice: No more pages and functions are there, except "Sign Up", "Sign In", "Reset PWD" and few functions in user's panel after login.

You can sign your own KEY after login and go here "https://dev.oobase.com/panel/?action=access_key"

You can develop your own modules offline for ooBase or make fully functional pages according to the simple API Document.
We could be very grateful for you if you donate your modules to ooBase.

NervSys is still going on its way, so we are sorry not to have the document done ready for developers.

Demo module is out and opened here https://github.com/Jerry-Shaw/fruit_picker. You can try it with NervSys with detailed comments in the picker.php

The next big update with two ways' communication will be continuing when the site and data center are completed.
